# pkpass-go

## Summary
This package will generate a signed Apple Wallet Pass given your companion files, and your Apple issued Pass Type Certificate.

For instructions on how to obtain these certifcates for your account, [please see this tutorial](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/PassKit_PG/YourFirst.html).

Currently, we depend on [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/). When running in production, I recommend installing this in your Docker container.

## Usage
```go
// Open your certifcate via a file, string reader, etc.
cert, err := os.Open("Certificates.p12")
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
defer cert.Close()
    
// Pass the directory containing your companiion files, the password you need
// to open your certificate, and the actual certificate to the New func.
r, err := pkpass.New("Coupon.pass", "", cert)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}

// The reader contains your freshly minted .pkpass file, just write it out so you can
// use it.
f, err := os.Create("Coupon.pkpass")
if err != nil {
    t.Fatal(err)
}
defer f.Close()

// Copy the reader into an actual file so that you can open it.
_, err = io.Copy(f, r)
if err != nil {
    panic(err)
}
```

## Certificates
When you log into your Apple Developer account, you should create a _Pass Type ID_. This type id will be what goes into your pass.json file, and will be what the certificate will be attached to. You should name this using the reverse domain convention.

```
pass.com.example.mypass
```

Once you have created a _Pass Type ID_, click edit. Follow the instructions to create and download your certificate. Likely, your certificate will be placced into _Keychain Access_ from there, you can export it, and use it with this package.

It is important that you update your `pass.json` file prior to creating the pass. You will need to substitute the `passTypeIdentifier` and  `teamIdentifier` for their actual values.
